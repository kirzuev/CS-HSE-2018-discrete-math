Homework for skipping a CS HSE Discrete Maths course.

Program reads a boolean expression, print its CNF and use resolution method to say "yes" if formula is satisfiable or "no" if it is not.

## Build and launch

Build the project with [Stack](https://www.haskellstack.org):

```
stack setup
stack build
```

Launch the project:

```
stack exec hw-exe
```

## Use a program

To handle a boolean expression type it and push `Enter` button. Then the program will type a CNF and the resolution method result.
